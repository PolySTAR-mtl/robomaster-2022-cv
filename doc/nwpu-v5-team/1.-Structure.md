# Software structure

Perception is the basis of decision-making. It provides real-time environment 
information for the decision-making module, such as enemy robots' location on 
the field. At the same time, perception allows robots to detect enemies
for striking, and provides global information through outpost 
cameras, thus allowing upper-level decision-making and lower-level actions. 
In this competition, there are two tasks the perception module needs to 
complete. One is object detection on robots, consisting of real-time detection 
of enemy robots and armor plate modules, while the other is global object 
detection and localization of cameras through outpost cameras.

The following figure shows the entire software system structure of our robots:

## Object detection on robots

The object detection module includes robot position detection and armor plate 
detection. The principle is to find the 2D coordinates of the target through 
object detection, and combine the depth information obtained by the *realsense* 
camera to compute the 3D coordinates to provide accurate targets for the turrets 
to strike.

According to the pixel-camera coordinate conversion formula, the relative 
camera position can be obtained:

## Sentinel camera

The sentinel camera module is used for global positioning, including two 
cameras detecting and locating targets on the field respectively. The global 
positioning information obtained by the sentinel camera will provide a 
reference for decision-making.
